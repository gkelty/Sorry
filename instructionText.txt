The point of the game is to get all 4 of your pawns from START to HOME.
The first to do so will be victorious!
Simply draw a card from the pile and do as it says.
You can knock an opponent back to START by landing on them. -
But be carful it could happen to you!
If you and on a spot with an arrow (that is not your color) you will slide to the end -
while worrying all pawns along the way, including your own. 
In order to start a game, simply press "New Game" on the main menu enter the 
desired info.
